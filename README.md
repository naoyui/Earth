## The math behind the comparisons

When you enter tonnes of CO₂, the tool converts it into things you can actually picture. Here's how.

### Basic Weight Conversions

- 1 tonne = 1,000 kilograms (kg)
- 1 Gigatonne (Gt) = 1,000,000,000 tonnes (1 billion tonnes)

## 1. PHYSICAL SIZE COMPARISONS

### A. TV Screens

**What we are calculating:**  
How many years of global TV production would it take to physically represent your CO₂ amount?

**The Math:**

```
Years = (CO₂ in tonnes × 1,000,000) ÷ 196,000,000
```

**The Assumptions:**

- 196 million TVs are produced globally each year
- We use a creative scaling factor where 1 tonne of CO₂ represents 1 million "production units"

**Example (80,000 tonnes):**

```
(80,000 × 1,000,000) ÷ 196,000,000 = 408.16 years
```

### B. Balcony Area (Volume)

**What we are calculating:**  
How big would your CO₂ be if you turned it into a solid block of dry ice?

**The Math:**

```
Volume in cubic meters (m³) = CO₂ tonnes ÷ 1.56
```

**The Assumptions:**

- Solid CO₂ (dry ice) density: ~1,560 kg/m³
- 1 tonne (1,000 kg) ÷ 1,560 kg/m³ = 0.64 m³ per tonne
- Dividing by 1.56 is the mathematical equivalent of multiplying by 0.64

**Example (80,000 tonnes):**

```
80,000 ÷ 1.56 = 51,282 m³ (Size of a large university campus)
```

### C. Basketball Court

**What we are calculating:**  
If you stretched a basketball court to fit this volume, how long would it be?

**The Math:**

```
Extension Factor = Volume ÷ (28 × 15)
Steps = (28 × Extension Factor × 2) ÷ 0.75
```

**The Assumptions:**

- Court Area: 420 m² (28m × 15m)
- Step length: 0.75m

**Example (80,000 tonnes / 51,282 m³):**

```
Extension = 51,282 ÷ 420 = 122.1 (The court is 122x longer than normal)
Steps = (28 × 122.1 × 2) ÷ 0.75 = 9,117 steps
```

### D. Football Fields

**What we are calculating:**  
How many football fields would your CO₂ cover if spread 1cm thick?

**The Math:**

```
Area (m²) = Volume ÷ 0.01
Fields = Area (m²) ÷ 7,140
```

**The Assumptions:**

- Standard FIFA Field: 105m × 68m ≈ 7,140 m²
- Layer thickness: 1 cm (0.01 m)

**Example (80,000 tonnes / 51,282 m³):**

```
Area = 51,282 ÷ 0.01 = 5,128,200 m²
Fields = 5,128,200 ÷ 7,140 = 718 fields
```

## 2. QUANTITY COMPARISONS

### A. Coffee Cups

**The Math:**

```
Total Cups = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 0.021
Days = Total Cups ÷ 5
```

**Assumption:** 21g (0.021 kg) CO₂ per cup

### B. Smartphones

**What we are calculating:**  
How many smartphones produce this much CO₂ during manufacturing?

**The Math:**

```
Smartphones = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 80
```

**The Assumptions:**

- Manufacturing one smartphone produces roughly 80 kg of CO₂e (including mining, rare earth processing, and complex assembly)

**Example (80,000 tonnes):**

```
80,000,000 kg ÷ 80 kg = 1,000,000 phones
```

### C. 2-Liter Bottles

**The Math:**

```
Bottles = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 0.5
Parties = Bottles ÷ 10
```

**Assumption:** 0.5 kg CO₂ to produce one plastic bottle

### D. Stars in the Galaxy

**The Math:**

```
Multiplier = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 250,000,000,000
```

**Assumption:** Milky Way has ~250 billion stars

## 3. WEIGHT COMPARISONS

- **Coins:** kg ÷ 0.0056 (5.6g per coin)
- **Suitcases:** kg ÷ 23 (23kg check-in limit)
- **People:** kg ÷ 70 (70kg average adult)
- **Cars:** kg ÷ 1,500 (1,500kg average car)

---

## 4. SEVERITY & CONTEXT

### A. Trees

**The Math:**

```
Trees = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 22
```

**Assumption:** One mature tree absorbs ~22kg CO₂/year

### B. Timeline to Climate Threshold

**What we are calculating:**  
If we added this amount weekly, how long until we burn the 1.5°C budget?

**The Math:**

```
Budget = 500,000,000,000 kg (500 Gt)
Weekly Rate = CO₂ tonnes × 1,000
Weeks = Budget ÷ Weekly Rate
Days = Weeks × 7
```

**Example (80,000 tonnes/week):**

```
Weeks = 500,000,000,000 ÷ 80,000,000 = 6,250,000 weeks
Days = 43,750,000 days
```

### C. Historical Context

**The Math:**

```
Gigatonnes (Gt) = CO₂ tonnes ÷ 1,000,000,000
```

**The Logic:**

- Input: 80,000 tonnes
- Result: 0.00008 Gt
- Context: Since this number is too small to compare to "Ice Ages" (which are 1,500+ Gt), the tool describes it as a "microscopic fraction" or uses the "Global Time Equivalent" (how many seconds of global emissions this represents)

### D. Systemic Impacts

**The Math:**

```
Warming (°C) = (Gt ÷ 1,000) × 0.45
```

**Example (80,000 tonnes = 0.00008 Gt):**

```
Warming = (0.00008 ÷ 1,000) × 0.45 = 0.000000036°C
```

**Statement:** "Contributes approximately 0.036 millionths of a degree."

## What's Real vs Creative?

**Scientifically accurate:** CO₂ density, atmospheric history, climate impacts, tree absorption

**Creative comparisons:** TV production, basketball stretching, Captain America, party counts

**Simplified but science-based:** All weight/volume/number calculations, climate sensitivity, ocean acidification

Turns abstract numbers into tangible comparisons. A tonne of CO₂ is hard to picture - "the weight of a car" or "what 45,000 coffee cups produce" makes it real.

Numbers were cross-referenced across multiple online articles. Historical context calculations drew heavily from Wikipedia's paleoclimate data.
