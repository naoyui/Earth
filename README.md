## The math behind the comparisons

When you enter tonnes of CO₂, the tool converts it into things you can actually picture. Here's how.

### Basic Weight Conversions

- 1 tonne = 1,000 kilograms (kg)
- 1 Gigatonne (Gt) = 1,000,000,000 tonnes (1 billion tonnes)

## 1. PHYSICAL SIZE COMPARISONS

### A. TV Screens

**What we are calculating:**  
How many years of global TV production would it take to physically represent your CO₂ amount?

```
Years = (CO₂ in tonnes × 1,000,000) ÷ 196,000,000
```

- 196 million TVs are produced globally each year
- We use a creative scaling factor where 1 tonne of CO₂ represents 1 million "production units"

### B. Balcony Area (Volume)

**What we are calculating:**  
How big would your CO₂ be if you turned it into a solid block of dry ice?

```
Volume in cubic meters (m³) = CO₂ tonnes ÷ 1.56
```

- Solid CO₂ (dry ice) density: ~1,560 kg/m³
- 1 tonne (1,000 kg) ÷ 1,560 kg/m³ = 0.64 m³ per tonne
- Dividing by 1.56 is the mathematical equivalent of multiplying by 0.64

### C. Basketball Court

**What we are calculating:**  
If you stretched a basketball court to fit this volume, how long would it be?

```
Extension Factor = Volume ÷ (28 × 15)
Steps = (28 × Extension Factor × 2) ÷ 0.75
```

- Court Area: 420 m² (28m × 15m)
- Step length: 0.75m

### D. Football Fields

**What we are calculating:**  
How many football fields would your CO₂ cover if spread 1cm thick?

```
Area (m²) = Volume ÷ 0.01
Fields = Area (m²) ÷ 7,140
```

- Standard FIFA Field: 105m × 68m ≈ 7,140 m²
- Layer thickness: 1 cm (0.01 m)

## 2. QUANTITY COMPARISONS

### A. Coffee Cups

```
Total Cups = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 0.021
Days = Total Cups ÷ 5
```

- 21g (0.021 kg) CO₂ per cup

### B. Smartphones

**What we are calculating:**  
How many smartphones produce this much CO₂ during manufacturing?

```
Smartphones = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 80
```

- Manufacturing one smartphone produces roughly 80 kg of CO₂e (including mining, rare earth processing, and complex assembly)

### C. 2-Liter Bottles

```
Bottles = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 0.5
Parties = Bottles ÷ 10
```

- 0.5 kg CO₂ to produce one plastic bottle

### D. Stars in the Galaxy

```
Multiplier = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 250,000,000,000
```

- Milky Way has ~250 billion stars (middle range)

## 3. WEIGHT COMPARISONS

- **Coins:** kg ÷ 0.0056 (5.6g per coin)
- **Suitcases:** kg ÷ 23 (23kg check-in limit)
- **People:** kg ÷ 70 (70kg average adult)
- **Cars:** kg ÷ 1,500 (1,500kg average car)

---

## 4. SEVERITY & CONTEXT

### A. Trees

```
Trees = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 22
```

- One mature tree absorbs ~22kg CO₂/year

### B. Timeline to Climate Threshold

**What we are calculating:**  
If we added this amount weekly, how long until we burn the 1.5°C budget?

```
Budget = 500,000,000,000 kg (500 Gt)
Weekly Rate = CO₂ tonnes × 1,000
Weeks = Budget ÷ Weekly Rate
Days = Weeks × 7
```

### C. Historical Context

```
Gigatonnes (Gt) = CO₂ tonnes ÷ 1,000,000,000
```

### D. Systemic Impacts

```
Warming (°C) = (Gt ÷ 1,000) × 0.45
```

## What's Real vs Creative:

**Real:** CO₂ density, atmospheric history, climate impacts, tree absorption, all weight/volume/number calculations, climate sensitivity, ocean acidification 

**Creative:** TV production, basketball stretching, Captain America, party counts, etc.

Turns abstract numbers into tangible comparisons, given a few approximations and assumptions. A tonne of CO₂ is hard to picture - "the weight of a car" or "what 45,000 coffee cups produce" makes it real. The purpose, however, is not the replacement of the real metric but providing a basis for easier communication. 

**Source:** Numbers were cross-referenced across multiple online articles. Historical context calculations drew heavily from Wikipedia's paleoclimate data.

## Version 1 vs Current Ver:

- Calculated 1 Gt = 1,000,000 tonnes. Fixed to:

  ```
   1 Gt = 1,000,000,000 tonnes
  ```

- Changed statements for Historical Context, Impact, and Timeline options to match fixed calculations
- Added more sound effects and typing indicators
- Learned why first deployment did not work
- Formatted READ ME
