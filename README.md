# How Carbon Metrics Works
## The math behind the comparisons

When you enter tonnes of CO₂, the tool converts it into things you can actually picture. Here's how.

---

## Weight Units

```
1 tonne = 1,000 kilograms
1 gigatonne (Gt) = 1 billion tonnes
```

Tonnes for everyday amounts, gigatonnes for atmospheric scale, kilograms for comparing with objects.

---

## PHYSICAL SIZE

### TV Screens

**The calculation:**
```
Years = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000,000) ÷ 196,000,000
```

**What we're assuming:**
- 196 million TVs made globally per year
- Each tonne scales to 1 million units
- Creative comparison, not direct physical equivalent

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 12.76 years of global TV production

---

### Balcony Area

**The calculation:**
```
Volume (m³) = CO₂ tonnes × 1.56
```

**What we're assuming:**
- Dry ice weighs 1,560 kg/m³
- 1 tonne = ~0.64 m³, rounded to 1.56 m³/tonne

**Size brackets:**
- Under 0.001 m³ → tennis ball
- Under 1 m³ → bathtub
- Under 75 m³ → apartment
- Under 1,000 m³ → supermarket
- Under 50,000 m³ → university campus
- Over 50,000 m³ → multiple campuses

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 3,900 m³ = university campus size

---

### Basketball Court

**The calculation:**
```
Extension = Volume ÷ (28 × 15)
Steps = (28 × Extension × 2) ÷ 0.75
```

**What we're assuming:**
- Court: 28m × 15m
- Average step: 0.75m
- Round trip (×2)

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** Court stretches 9× longer, 695 steps end to end

---

### Football Fields

**The calculation:**
```
Area = Volume ÷ 0.01
Fields = (Area in km²) ÷ 0.0071
Earth % = (Fields × 0.0071) ÷ 148,940,000 × 100
```

**What we're assuming:**
- Field: 105m × 68m = 0.0071 km²
- Spread 1cm thick
- Earth's land: 148.94 million km²

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 55 fields, 0.0003% of Earth's surface

---

## QUANTITY

### Coffee Cups

**The calculation:**
```
Cups = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 0.021
Days = Cups ÷ 5
```

**What we're assuming:**
- One cup: 21g CO₂ (growing to disposal)
- Safe intake: 5 cups/day

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 119 million cups = 65,205 years at 5/day

---

### Smartphones

**The calculation:**
```
Phones = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 0.08
```

**What we're assuming:**
- Manufacturing one phone: 80g CO₂
- Excludes usage and disposal

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 31.25 million phones

---

### 2-Liter Bottles

**The calculation:**
```
Bottles = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 0.5
Parties = Bottles ÷ 10
```

**What we're assuming:**
- One bottle: 500g CO₂
- Small party: 10 bottles

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 5 million bottles = 500,000 parties

---

### Stars in the Galaxy

**The calculation:**
```
Multiplier = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 250,000,000,000
```

**What we're assuming:**
- Milky Way: 250 billion stars (middle estimate)

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 0.00001× the number of stars

---

## WEIGHT

### Coins
```
Coins = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 0.0056
```
Average coin: 5.6g (US quarter)

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 446 million coins

---

### Suitcases
```
Suitcases = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 23
```
Standard checked bag: 23 kg

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 109,000 suitcases

---

### People
```
People = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 70
```
Average adult: 70 kg

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 36,000 people

---

### Cars
```
Cars = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 1,500
Captain Americas = (Cars × 1,500) ÷ 450
```
Average car: 1,500 kg | Captain America lifts: 450 kg

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 1,667 cars, needs 5,556 Captain Americas

---

## SEVERITY & CONTEXT

### Trees

**The calculation:**
```
Trees = (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000) ÷ 22
```

**What we're assuming:**
- One mature tree: 22 kg CO₂/year
- Varies by species and location

**Example (2,500 tonnes):** 114,000 trees for one year

---

### Climate Threshold

**The calculation:**
```
Weeks = 500,000,000,000 ÷ (CO₂ tonnes × 1,000)
Days = Weeks × 7
```

**What we're assuming:**
- Remaining budget: ~500 Gt for 1.5°C
- Your amount added weekly
- Simplified model

**Example (2,500 tonnes/week):** 3,835 years to hit threshold

---

### Historical Context

**The conversion:**
```
Gigatonnes = CO₂ tonnes ÷ 1,000,000
```

**The timeline:**

| Gt | When | What |
|-----|------|------|
| 1,404-1,638 | 20,000 years ago | Last Ice Age |
| 1,638-2,184 | 10,000-800,000 years ago | Between ice ages |
| 2,184 | 1900s | Industrial revolution |
| 3,276 | 2024 | Current level |
| 3,120-3,276 | 3-3.3M years ago | Pliocene (2-3°C warmer) |
| 5,928 | 34M years ago | Antarctic ice forming |
| 12,480-18,720 | 400M years ago | First forests |
| 31,200 | 500M years ago | Early complex life |
| 936,000 | 635M years ago | Snowball Earth ending |

**The science:** 1 ppm atmospheric CO₂ = 7.8 Gt | Current: ~420 ppm = ~3,276 Gt

---

### Systemic Impacts

**The formula:**
Per 1,000 Gt of CO₂:
- Temperature: +0.5-0.7°C
- Sea level: +1.5-2.0m (long-term)
- Ocean pH: -0.05

**The calculation:**
```
CO₂ in Gt = CO₂ tonnes ÷ 1,000,000
Warming (low-high) = (Gt ÷ 1,000) × [0.5-0.7]°C
Sea rise (low-high) = (Gt ÷ 1,000) × [1.5-2.0]m
pH drop = (Gt ÷ 1,000) × 0.05
```

**What we're assuming:**
- Long-term equilibrium values (centuries+)
- Based on paleoclimate and models
- Rough estimates, vary by region

**Response levels:**

**Very Small (<1 Gt):** General explanation about cumulative effects

**Small-Medium (1-100 Gt):**
Example (50 Gt): 0.025-0.035°C, 7.5-10cm, pH -0.0025

**Medium-Large (100-1,000 Gt):**
Example (500 Gt): 0.25-0.35°C, 0.75-1.0m, pH -0.025

**Very Large (>1,000 Gt):**
Example (5,000 Gt): 2.5-3.5°C, 7.5-10m, pH -0.25

### Why These Comparisons?

Connect to consumer products, sports fields, everyday objects, historical context, and concrete climate impacts.

### What's Real vs Creative?

**Scientifically accurate:** CO₂ density, atmospheric history, climate impacts, tree absorption

**Creative comparisons:** TV production, basketball stretching, Captain America, party counts

**Simplified but science-based:** All weight/volume/number calculations, climate sensitivity, ocean acidification

Turns abstract numbers into tangible comparisons. A tonne of CO₂ is hard to picture - "the weight of a car" or "what 45,000 coffee cups produce" makes it real.

Numbers were cross-referenced across multiple online articles. Historical context calculations drew heavily from Wikipedia's paleoclimate data.Numbers were cross-referenced across multiple online articles. Historical context calculations drew heavily from Wikipedia's paleoclimate data.
